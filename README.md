Literally a Twitter/X clone.

You go to the Home Page by logging in from the Username and Password screen prepared by coding the character restrictions on the user screen.

You can navigate between current tweets and tweets uploaded on the Home Page prepared in Light and Dark modes, click on the tweet details and review the relevant tweet.

You can also search for tweets via API request from the Home Page.

In this time-consuming project created with all the details in mind,

Extensive JavaScript has been used along with HTML and CSS. You can examine how API requests are received and transferred to the interface in JavaScript files.

Please take a look at the image of the project below.
